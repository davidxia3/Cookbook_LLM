Once pulverized add in 1 clove of garlic & continue to grind. Now add in your nuts, lemon juice and a bit of salt & pepper & give it one more grind.

For crostini I would leave as a paste, for a pasta sauce keep it a bit looser - this is all based on the amount of olive oil you use.\nNow recheck your seasonings - more garlic? A little light on the acid? Add a squeeze of lemon. Is it flat? A pinch of salt will wake it up. Let sit for an hour or so to let the flavors incorporate. Store in the fridge. It will last a few days before the arugula will turn.\nServe tossed over fresh pasta or rubbed over toasty bread with a ribbon of parmesan, a delicious topping for pizza or a beautiful frittata with a dollop of arugula pesto!

Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.\n2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.\n3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.\n4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp.

Scoop the pesto out and into a dish or a bowl or a jar.Cooking Tip** At this point if you wanted to can this you could. Or you can scoop it into an ice cube tray and freeze it! after about 6 hours when it is frozen just pop them out and put the pesto cubes in a zip lock bag or air tight container and freeze them! They will keep for a month! Then anytime you want to add it to a recipe you can pop it out and toss it in and kick anything you are making up a notch! Once it is thawed out you can stir in the Parmesan cheese.Now you want to add the grated Parmesan.At this point you need to test it and see how much salt you need to add. You can add a dash in when you are blending it but the Parmesan cheese is salty so I like to wait until after and if it needs a little bit then I add it in at the end. This way I can make sure it is not too salty or too bland. Once you have salted it and stirred it up you are done!"}
