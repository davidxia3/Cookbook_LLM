In medium bowl  whisk egg, oil, sugars, flavorings and coffee.  Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients using a spoon or spatula.  Batter will be somewhat lumpy -- do not over mix it to make it smooth.  Using an ice cream scoop (1/4 cup), fill paper liners.  Bake about 16 minutes, or till a toothpick inserted near center returns with just a few crumbs.  Cool in pan 5 minutes, then turn cupcakes out onto wire rack to completely cool.PEANUT-BUTTER FILLING:  In small bowl, combine all ingredients.  Core cooled cupcakes with a Cuisipro or other hollowing device, and fill cavity with peanut butter filling.  Eat the cupcake pieces you cored; sandwich two with some peanut butter filling and marshmallow frosting.MARSHMALLOW FROSTING:  In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, bring water, corn syrup and 1/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp. sugar to a rolling boil on high heat, brushing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush.  Do not stir mixture, as it will cause it to crystallize.  Boil until mixture reaches 242F, or soft-ball stage.In the meantime, a few minutes after the sugar mixture comes to a boil, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl.  Using regular beaters on medium-high speed whip egg whites, vanilla powder or extract, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes.  With mixer still on, sprinkle the remaining 1 Tbsp. of sugar over the whites and continue beating until whites hold very soft peaks, another 2 minutes.  When syrup has reached 242F, reduce mixer speed to low.  Find the sweet spot (between the sides of the bowl and the beaters) and very, very slowly and carefully drizzle in the hot syrup.  After all syrup has been added, turn mixer to high and beat till thick, fluffy and just barely warm, about 7 minutes.  Fit a 16\" piping bag with a 1M Wilton tip; spoon frosting into bag and pipe onto cupcakes making high mounds of frosting.GARNISHES:  Place chocolate into one bottom corner of a resealable plastic bag.  Microwave on high about 30 seconds.  Continue microwaving on high at 10-second intervals until chocolate is melted.  Very carefully cut the tiniest corner to make a very small hole through which the chocolate may be drizzled onto the frosting.  Lightly sprinkle peanuts over cupcakes.TIME-SAVING TIPS:  Instead of making peanut butter filling, just use Peanut Butter & Co.'s White Chocolate Wonderful Peanut Butter.  If you're not lactose intolerant, you could use a cake mix for the cupcakes, but you will have to double the other ingredients."

Depending on the size of the chicken breasts, this could take anywhere from 15 - 20 minutes.While the chicken is boiling, put together your sauce. Whisk together greek yogurt, dijon mustard, and garlic powder together until well mixed. Add in salt and pepper, to taste.Next, stir in dried cranberries or raisins and cashews. If you're worried about the cashews getting too soft, you could add them right before serving!After the chicken is done boiling, I like to let it rest for about 5 minutes. This ensures that the juice stays in the chicken instead of spilling out when you cut it!Dice up the chicken and mix it into the sauce. Serve."

Using two knives or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the texture rangers from cornmeal to the size of small peas. (These two steps can be done quickly in a food processor.) Using a fork, gradually mix in the yogurt, then the milk, until the dough is quite soft and somewhat sticky. Work quickly without overworking the dough. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly, just long enough to get it to hold together. Roll it out so it is about 1 1/4 inches thick, and cut it into 2 i3. While the biscuits are baking, prepare the sausages: place all the sausage ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly, using your fingers.To test the seasoning, fry a tiny patty and taste; adjust if necessary.4. Place the patties in a large heavy or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until they are crisp and brown on the outside and cooked through inside, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer the sausage patties to a warmed platter and keep warm.5. Make the gravy: Add enough of the butter to the skillet so the bottom is covered with 1/8 inch of fat. Stir, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and add the flour slowly, stirring until it has absorbed the butter. Cook, stirring constantly, until it turns golden brown, at least 2 minutes. Then slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly, and cook until the gravy thickens to the consistency of very heavy cream.<6. To serve, split two biscuits in half. Place the bottom halves on a warm plate, top them with sausage patties, and pour a generous amount of gravy over the sausage. Mince the fresh sage and sprinkle some over the sausage and gravy. Set the biscuit tops at an angle, partially covering the sausages and serve immediately.4 servings (with extra biscuits)."

Make sure your bowl does not touch the simmering water. The more you stir the shinier your cookies will be.When the chocolate and shortening has melted, remove the bowl from the heat; stir to assure it's completely mixed. Set aside to cool a few minutes.Meanwhile, in another bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla paste, and espresso. Set aside.In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside.Whisk the melted chocolate into the sugar/egg mixture.Add the flour mixture, whisk. Only whisk until blended, over-mixing can affect the texture of the pies.Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, no need to grease the paper.Drop a heaping tablespoon of batter (keeping the shapes as round as possible) onto the baking sheets. You are aiming for rounds that are about 2 inches in diameter. Take care to leave some room (about 2 inches) between each one to allow for spreading that will occur as they bake.Bake for 6 to 8 minutes.Leave in the oven an additional minute if they seem under baked. The cookie will have a brownie like crackling surface, and will feel soft, when ready.Allow them to cool for about 10 minutes before gently lifting them off the baking sheet and onto a flat surface for piping the filling.For the Filling:Combine 1 1/4 cups sugar and the water in a small saucepan.Heat over medium heat with a candy thermometer attached to the inside of the saucepan, and stir to dissolve. When the mixture reaches 220 degrees F it is ready for the stand mixer.Meanwhile, in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on medium speed until it begins to look very foamy(about 3 minutes).Avoiding the whisk, gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons PLUS 1 teaspoon sugar. Increase the speed to high and whip until soft white peaks are formed.At this point check to see if your sugar has cooled. If it has cooled, turn heat back on to high until it comes back up to 220 degrees F just before adding to stand mixer.When egg whites are at a soft peak stage resembling marshmallow fluff,slowly add the hot sugaralong the edge of the mixer avoiding the whisk.Continue to whisk on high until the bowl has cooled, about 5 minutes.Add peppermint extract, whisk another 30 seconds.Refrigerate for 5 minutes before transferring to a piping bag with a plain tip attached or a large ziploc bag with one corner cut a 1/4 inch.For Garnish:Place candy canes between layers of wax paper, then sandwich between a dish towel.Using a meat tenderizer, or the back of a dry measuring cup, pound the candy cane until broken up into very small pieces.Make sure the candy cane is between wax paper first, otherwise, the candy cane will stick to the dish towel.Assemble:Turn the brookie cookies upside down, pipe about 2 tablespoons of filling onto half of the cookies.Cover each filled cookie with a dry cookie, press down just enough so that filling adheres to the cookie.Sprinkle crushed candy cane around the brookie pie edges.Serve chilled or at room temperature."

If the batter is too thick, add a few tablespoons of hemp milk at a time, up to 1/2 cup more hemp milk to make a pourable batter. (The batter should be thin enough to spread easily in the pan). Allow the batter rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.Heat an 8- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add a small dab of virgin coconut oil for cooking. Pour about 1/2 cup batter into the skillet and at the same time, rotate the pan so the batter covers a thin layer on the bottom. Use small amounts of batter to repair any holes; work quickly and keep the crepe thin.Cook until the top of the crepe is dry, after about 1 minute, loosen the edges of the crepe from the pan with a spatula. Flip with your fingers or gently toss and flip (this may take a few attempts, but works best) and cook the other side for 30 to 60 seconds. Stack the cooked crepes on a plate. Keep them warm in a low oven or fill each crepe while it's in the pan, spooning the filling across the lower third of the crepe. Roll the crepe from the filling end or fold the bottom third over the filling, fold in the sides, then fold the crepe from the bottom up to make a pocket. Repeat the process, adding more coconut oil between crepes as needed, until all the batter is used up. "

Sprinkle salt and fresh ground black pepper liberally all over the fish, and set aside.\nMelt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat\nAdd the onions and saute for a few minutes, until they become translucent. Be sure not to brown them in any way.\nreduce heat to very low, cover the Dutch oven tightly, and cook onions for about 20 minutes, stirring once or twice to prevent browning. Onions should be fully flavored, lightly yellow, but not brown, and most of the onion juices should be gone. If this state isnt reached in 20 minutes, cover and cook longer, checking every 5 minutes for doneness.\nWhisk the eggs and cream together\nRemove onions from heat, add egg and cream mixture and stir very thoroughly, until creamy and uniform.\nSeason with salt and pepper to taste, add nutmeg.\nFinally, add the cheese and stir gently to distribute.\nAdd paprika if desire.\nSprinkle the surface of the table with flour lightly\nRoll out puff pastry to be slightly larger than the baking pan (I used a 10 pie pan).\nLine the baking pan with the layer of puff pastry, press it into the sides of the pan to form a pie shell.\nPierce the shell all over with the fork\nFold out half of the egg and onion mixture into the baking pan\nArrange the fish slices over in a single layer, covering the entire surface of the pie\nFold out the other half of the egg and onion mixture over the fish layer\nIf you wish to make patterns in the pie, make them at this time. I improvised and used a plastic cap of a water bottle to cut out incomplete circles in the crust. While baking, the circles puffed out and shrunk, creating little peek-a-boo openings in the pie.\nCarefully transfer the top pie crust onto the top of the pie. Stretch out if necessary to distribute your patterns nicely.\nUsing a rolling pin, press the pie crusts together to the rim of the baking pan, thus cutting the extras off without stretching the crusts.\nBake for about 30 minutes at 425F, or until the egg and onion mixture is set in the middle, and pie crust is golden and flaky."

Saute for about 7-10 minutes- you want all the veggies to be soft and cooked through.\nMeanwhile in a small bowl, add the cubed tofu, a pinch of turmeric, cumin powder, coarse black pepper and some cayenne pepper (totally optional!). Mix and set aside to marinate for a bit.\nOnce the veggies are cooked, add the tofu- saute until slightly brown and soft enough that it crumbles. Add juice form half a lemon and half of the chopped cilantro. Mix and add the diced boiled potato, and toss until everything is coated, soft and taste for salt/spices. Using a masher, mash the mixture until mushy and until the veggies are small. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, add a bit of the breadcrumbs and mix with your hands. Start forming into thick patties (mixture should make 4). If its still giving you a hard time, add more breadcrumbs. Make 4 patties, place on a plate and wrap with plastic wrap until ready to use.\nIn a small skillet sprayed with PAM over medium-high heat, add one patty at a time. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side- until browned and crispy.At the same time, saute the thick slices of onion, until charred and slightly soft. Spread a generous amount of the chutney spread on each side on the bread, place burger, onions tomato and cilantro leaves. Serve with a slice of lemon and reduced-fat chips on the side."

I find this only takes about 10 minutes.\nMix together the cornstarch and water, and pour it into the pudding mixture.\nReheat over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture starts to thicken. It'll thicken fast with all that corn starch!\nTurn heat to low, and continue to stir vigorously while keeping it at a good simmer for about a minute.\nRemove from heat, and stir in the whiskey and vanilla. Whiskey wasn't in my original Butterscotch Pudding recipe, but I love the addition for this pie. Gives it a little extra somethin' somethin'.\nPour the pudding mixture into the chilled pie crust.\nCover with plastic wrap and chill for at least two hours.\nReady for the topping? Whip the 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream with the wire whisk attachment on your stand mixer (you can do this by hand, but it would be quite the workout).\nAdd the sugar and vanilla to the cream while it's whipping. It's ready when soft peaks form. Yum.\nI'm stating the obvious, but remove the pie from the fridge and take off the plastic wrap.\nPile on the whipping cream. I like to spread it almost to the edges, but not quite - gotta give folks a glimpse of the actual pie yumminess!\nIf you want, garnish with a little shaved chocolate.

Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes. Leave the oven on.While your potatoes are cooling, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese. Drizzle with avocado cream and serve immediately.Enjoy!I hope you enjoy this recipe for brown butter twice baked sweet potatoes!"

Set aside.In a medium bowl, sift together, or whisk the flours, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and kosher salt.In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat together the butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until well combined.Add the mashed banana, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula when needed.Add the pumpkin puree and sour cream mixture and continue to mix on low speed.Add in the flour mixture.The batter will be quite thick which is how it should be.Note: If your batter is not thick for some reason add 1/4 cup of white rice flour.Spread half of the thick batter into the prepared pan.Sprinkle half of the streusel over the batter.Add the remaining batter over the streusel and spread the thick batter evenly.Evenly spread the remaining streusel over the batter.Bake 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.Transfer the cake in the pan to your stovetop and let it cool for about 40 minutes.When cooled, remove the sides of the cake from the pan using a spreader type knife, or something that will not scratch your cake pan.Gently lift up the cake by pressing the removable bottom upwards.I then refrigerated the cake with the bottom part still holding the cake for about an hour.Transfer the chilled cake to a cake platter.Put pieces of wax or parchment paper under the edges of the cake to keep the glaze drips from making a mess of your platter.For the glaze:In a glass bowl set over a small saucepan with simmering water, combine mini chips with Earth Balance spread.Mix often to get a glossy sheen.When completely melted take off the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes before glazing the cake.Using a large spoon drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the cake.Slowly pull out the papers along the cake.Serve chilled, or room temperature."

Put garlic cloves under the skin of the chicken\n3. Chop the onion and scatter around the bottom of the pan. Pour in water.\nSalsa Verde\n1. Remove the hulls from the tomatillos. They will be sticky, don't worry if you can't wash it all off. Remove the stems.\n2. Place all the tomatillos and chiles into a sauce pot. Cover with water and boil until soft.\n3. Remove the tomatillos and chiles from the water and place in a blender. Add all the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.\n4. It's as simple as that. A yummy salsa perfect for tamales, eating with chip or putting on top of whatever you're eating!\nTamale Dough (Masa)\nMix all together to make a soft, sticky dough.\nSalsa Verde Tamales\nTamale Dough\nShreded chicken\n2 cups Salsa Verde\n10 to 40 green olives\n4 medium potatoes\n1. Remove the corn husks from the bag and place them in a pot of hot water. Continue to heat on low for   at least 30 minutes. You want them to be pliable.\n2. Add your shreded chicken to a skillet and cover with  about two cups of salsa verde.\n3. If you have large olives you will want to cut them in 1/2 or in 1/4. If they are small you might just want to leave them whole. I prefer to remove the pit but you don't have too, just watch out when you bit into the tamale. Place in small bowl and set aside.\n4. Cut the potatoes into small, thick strips. You don't have to remove the peel.  I used red potatoes because that is all I had. Normally I would use  regular old potatoes. Place in a small bowl, cover with water  to previent them from turning brown and set aside.\n5. Now comes the fun part! Asembling the tamales! It is best to do this with a firend. My sister helped me since I am visiting her right now. Remove the soaked corn husks from the pot.\n6. Pick out the husk you want to use. Normally one big one is enough. If the are small you may have to use two, overlapping a bit.\n7. Spred about 2TBS of the dough across the bottom half of the husk, narrow end pointing away from you about 1/8 in thick. Going a little more than half way up, leaving a tiny bit of room on the sides.\n8. Now place a small amount of chicken in the middle of the dough. I can't remember the exact amount I used.\n9. Place a potatoe sclice in the middle of the chicken and an olive at the end.\n10. Fold in one side and then the other. Fold up the bottom. If you want you can tie them closed with a small strip of husk. I don't.\n11. In a large pot pour in a about two cups of water. Place as many tamales that will fit in the pot, open end facing up. Place the lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and steam for 30 to 45 minutes.\n12. Remove from the pot and enjoy!! You will know that they are done when the husk can be pulled away from the masa and not stick. I served mine with refried beans and rice. The rice recipe will soon to follow, hopefully! This recipe made almost 4 dozen tamales. They can be frozen to save for later. Simply let them defrost and steam until warm."

Combine this yolk mixture with the chocolate mixture whisk until well blended.In a very clean, large glass bowl beat the 4 egg whites on medium-high and add the cream of tartar or lemon juice and beat until soft peaks form. This should take about 3 minutes. Beat another minute while slowly adding the 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. Then beat 1 more minute. The whites should be stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture in 3 different batches until no white streaks remain.Pour the cake batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the top. Bake in the oven on a center rack for about 20 minutes. The cake is done when a knife inserted comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least 1 hour. Run a knife along the edge of the pan to loosen the cake and then release the sides of the springform pan and lift off. Use a spatula to separate the cake from the bottom and lift off the parchment paper.In a clean glass bowl, whip the whipping cream until it starts to form peaks and add the chai and powdered sugar. Continue to whip until soft peaks form. Do not over whip or it will turn into butter.Serve with a dollop of chai-spiced whipped cream."

Once it is all mixed together stick your saucepan in the freezer while you chop the nuts and prepare the ice cream maker.\nChop the almonds. I did a rough chop and tried to chop them different ways so you get a different size bite each time.\nOnce you have the nuts chopped and your marshmallows measured out get the ice cream maker bowl out of the freezer and put it in the ice cream maker. Set it up so it is ready to use. Take your chocolate mixture out of the freezer and pour it into the ice cream maker. Turn the ice cream maker on.

Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined.  Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet.  There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).Put on a pretty plate and serve to your friends."

Whisk with the xanthan gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk well, breaking up any lumps of cocoa powder.

Add vanilla extract, applesauce, and egg replacer, and mix till combined, about 30 seconds.Add dry ingredients to stand mixer, in two batches, mixing on medium-low speed, until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.Using a rubber spatula, transfer cookie dough to a sheet of parchment paper. Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.Preheat oven to 325F. Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.Bake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez"

Chop the empty pod into small pieces, and add to the cream too.Bring the cream mixture to boiling point, then lower the heat and simmer gently for 3 minutes.Lightly beat the sugar and eggs together in a large bowl until pale and smooth.Strain the cream mixture through a fine sieve and bring back to boil. Gradually add the cream to the eggs while whisking vigorously. This will temper the eggs so that they do not curdle. Once all of the the cream has been added into the eggs, strain again and pour the mixture into 7-8 ramekins depending on size.Put the ramekins in a large cake pan or roasting pan and pour in enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.Cook on the centre shelf for about 30-40 minutes, or until the custards are just set and still a bit wobbly in the middle. Remove the ramekins from the water and allow to cool to room temperature and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or till next day.Before ready to serve, sprinkle some caster sugar evenly over the custard, then caramelise with a blowtorch."

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.\n2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.\n3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.\n4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it."

You take all the arugula, walnuts, garlic and parsley and put it in your blender or food processor.Give it a pulse a few times to chop everything down a little bit.Now you are going to pour in the oil while you hit the pulse button to make sure the pesto is mixing while the oil is added.Take off the lid and you are almost done! Scoop the pesto out and into a dish or a bowl or a jar.Cooking Tip** At this point if you wanted to can this you could. Or you can scoop it into an ice cube tray and freeze it! after about 6 hours when it is frozen just pop them out and put the pesto cubes in a zip lock bag or air tight container and freeze them! They will keep for a month! Then anytime you want to add it to a recipe you can pop it out and toss it in and kick anything you are making up a notch! Once it is thawed out you can stir in the Parmesan cheese.Now you want to add the grated Parmesan.At this point you need to test it and see how much salt you need to add. You can add a dash in when you are blending it but the Parmesan cheese is salty so I like to wait until after and if it needs a little bit then I add it in at the end. This way I can make sure it is not too salty or too bland. Once you have salted it and stirred it up you are done!"

I used 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Process till the onions and garlic are finely chopped.Sweat the onion-garlic mixture in a frying pan with some olive oil. I just realised that I had missed this step. The meatballs still tasted great.Add the onion-garlic mixture to 500g ground beef in a mixing bowl.Slice off the crust of 4 slices of white bread. Cut the soft white bread into small cubes of 1cm all round.Add the chopped bread to the beef mixture.Add 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley. Use Italian flat parsley where possible. I couldnt find any, so I used English parsley.Add 1 large egg.Add salt and pepper to taste. I used approximately 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper.Mix well to combine.Shape the meat mixture into balls that are slightly bigger than the size of a golf ball size. Roll the meat tightly to form meatballs.Add 3/4 cup of olive oil to frying pan. The layer of oil should be approximately 3/4cm in the pan.Put the pan on medium-high heat and add the meatballs to the oil. Gently roll them around in the oil to brown all surfaces and ensure even cooking.When the meatballs are a deep golden brown, remove them from the frying pan and set aside.The tomatoes-onion mixture should have reduced to a sauce consistency now. You can use a hand blender to puree the mixture.

Give them a quick sprinkling with a pinch of sea salt.Repeat with the remaining dough.These cookies are best eaten warm from the oven or later that same day. They also keep beautifully in the freezer, either by freezing the dough or freezing the cookies once they're cooled. 20-30 seconds in the microwave is all you need to warm one up!"

If the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. Add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. It should form a nice ball of dough. Once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes.Cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes.While your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. Grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. Now add in the garlic.Next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms.Let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. Give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach.Let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat.Now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli.Rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness.If you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday.After you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta.Brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. Seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face.Grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. The pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked)Grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. At this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic.Now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble.Drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated.Serve them up with a little grated Parmesan or Romano over the top."

Continue processing or mixing until dough comes together in a mass.Take rounded teaspoons of batter and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet approximately two inches apart. (I started off with loonie sized chunks of dough which was too big. Its more like the size of a quarter. Remember, youre aiming for 50 to 60 of these individual wafers!) With moistened hands, slightly flatten the dough. Bake for 9 minutes, rotating once for even baking. Set baking sheets on a rack to cool.To make the cream, place butter and shortening in a mixing bowl, and at low speed, gradually beat in the sugar and vanilla. Turn the mixer on high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes until filling is light and fluffy.To assemble the cookies, in a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch, round tip, pipe teaspoon-size blobs of cream into the center of one cookie. Place another cookie, equal in size to the first, on top of the cream. Lightly press, to work the filling evenly to the outsides of the cookie. (I dont think its entirely necessary to use a pastry bag. You could just spoon some icing on and squeeze between two wafers.) Continue this process until all the cookies have been sandwiched with cream."

Season your onions and chicken with garlic, cumin, and chili powder. Finely chop up your jalapeno and add that and your green chilis to your chicken mixture. Stir in your cheese. Now you are ready to assemble.Heat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn't reach the top side. Doing this softens your tortilla so it won't break as you roll it. Do this with all your tortillas and drain on paper towels.Take 2 cookie sheets and spray with cooking spray. Lay out a tortilla and add about 2 TBSP of chicken mixture to the middle of your tortilla. Roll up. Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching. This should make two rows on each of your cookie sheets.If two pans are too much for your family, then at this point, take one pan and put it in your freezer. Once the enchiladas are frozen, remove them from the pan and stack them in a double lined ziploc freezer bag. When you want to make them, simply line them up again on a greased cookie sheet, let thaw for about an hour on the counter, then bake as instructed.)Now, bake your enchiladas in the oven, at 400 degrees, for about 20 minutes. They should be lightly browned. Remove them from the oven and spoon over about 2TBSP of your enchilada sauce over the top of each enchilada. Then sprinkle the tops with cheese. Put the enchiladas back in the oven for about 7 minutes. After that, it's time to eat!"

When fully incorporated, increase speed to medium and then to high, and whip until stiff-peaked.  Timing varies on this, and this is where practice makes perfect.  Add your food coloring gel when almost completely done whipping.Sift 1/3 of the flour into the egg and fold in completely.  Repeat until all the flour is incorporated.  You want to fold in until the batter is smooth, but still light.Spoon into pastry bag fitted with a large tip (I use between 1/2 and 1 inch, depending on what I grab first).  Pipe 1 inch rounds onto parchment lined baking sheets, pulling the tip to the side so as to not leave a peak mark.  I use very thick sheets for this recipe.  Double up if needed.Tap the pan somewhat assertively on the counter to remove any trapped air and help batter to settle.Let sit for 1/2  2 hours, until a shell forms on the top and your finger pressed lightly doesnt leave a mark.Now, bakers are completely split on the right temperature for baking macarons.  Some bake slowly at 270-350 degrees.  I tried to keep my temperamental oven at around 300 for these, holding the door slightly ajar with a spoon.  This way I can keep them in longer to assure that the insides are cooked without browning them on top, which happened with a batch that was drier / baked higher.Bake in fully preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn the pan, and bake for around 8 minutes more, or until the feet of the macaron are a bit sturdier than soft.Cool on sheets for two minutes, then remove to rack to cool completely.Fill with prepared lemon curd and refrigerate to harden. Serve at room temperature with tea.  Preferably wearing a skirt.  Or at least barefoot."

If the bottom half looks just about cooked, roughly 3 minutes, flip over, and place cheese on top.Add red onions and buns (cut side down).Close lid.  After another 3 or so minutes, remove everything from grill.  The cheese wont be completely melted, because of the thickness, but its okay, thats the point ;-)  The cheese will stay extra sharp if the inside isnt melted.  On the red onions, youre looking for good char marks on one side, but the onion still a bit crunchy.  For the buns, youre looking to get the bottoms nice and charred, but not so much as to make the bread tough.To assemble the burger:  Place a handful of arugula leaves on the bottom slice of the bun.Place burger with cheese slice on top.Add the grilled red onions.Slather the aioli liberally on the top half of the bun."

Place in fridge for at least an hour.Toss lamb with salt, pepper, caraway seeds, garlic and flour.  Set aside.As dough chills, swirl a bit of olive oil in the bottom of a very wide and deep pan. When sizzling, add lamb pieces and cook on medium heat until just browned.  Scoop onto a separate plate.If necessary, swirl a bit more olive oil in the same pan.  Scrape up all the drippings on the pan, then slide onion and celery, cooking down until they soften and go translucent.Pour in wine and demi glace.  Stir well.  Add lamb back to the vegetables, followed by peas and bay leaf.   Cover, turn down to a simmer and cook about 15 minutes.Stir together water and cornstarch and pour into lamb and veggies.  Mix well.  Add sweet potatoes and cook another 5-7 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool completely.  Remove bay leaf.Once filling has cooled, take chilled dough and, on a floured surface, roll one ball for bottom crust layer.  Drop in 9-inch pie dish and trim edges.  Place in the fridge and roll second piece of dough for top.Remove bottom crust layer from fridge and pour in filling.  Top with second layer and trim edges if necessary.  Roll top crust edge over bottom crust.  Put back in the fridge or pop in freezer 2-4 minutes for a quick chill if dough feels at all soft.*Just before baking, brush milk over top crust. Bake in a preheated oven at 375 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown.Heres where you can make this dish early. Let the filling cool completely in the fridge.  When cool, assemble pie with both layers and filling and chill until ready to bake.  As for the continuous chilling methods, this is the best way to keep a flakey crust.  Never, never, never bake soft, soggy dough.  Avoid a disaster and overchill if necessary!"

Sprinkle polenta crust with freshly ground pepper, and bake for 30 minutes, until nicely browned around the edges. Keep the oven on.\nWhile crust is baking, prepare the toppings.  In a skillet, heat 1 tbsp olive oil. Saute pancetta, shallots and garlic for about 7-8 minutes, until nicely golden and very fragrant. Dont overcook.\nRemove the pancetta topping into a bowl and set aside.\nHeat a bit more oil in the same skillet and saute baby spinach until wilted and dark green, for about 3 minutes or so. Again, remove the spinach and set aside.\nAdd pepper slices and saute for a couple of minutes until they are nicely wilted, for about 3-4 minutes.\nLayer your toppings atop polenta crust, starting with cheese crumbs, followed by pancetta mix, spinach, peppers, and finally pine nuts. Arrange everything in a pretty way. Drizzle just a few drops more of olive oil, and put back in the oven for 4-5 minutes.\nSlice like a pizza or cut into 3 inch squares. Serve immediately."

Remove before frying to give enough time to bring the meat up to room temperature.\n2.In a dish or bowl combine the flour, half teaspoon of salt, smoked paprika, thyme and pepper. Combine with your fingers or a fork.\n3.Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and dispose of the marinade. Shake off most of the drips and then dredge the chicken in your flour mix making sure each piece is covered completely.\n4.Heat about 1.5cm / 0.5 in. of oil in a heavy bottomed wide pan. While this is heating up you can get a wire rack ready to drain the chicken. I do this by placing kitchen paper over the rack.\n5.The oil temperature should be about 170C / 340F for frying. I dont check with a thermometer but by putting a piece of bread in the oil and it is ready when it fizzes and turns brown quickly. The time the oil takes to heat up will depend on the thickness of the metal of your pan, your stove top and the quantity of oil you have used.\n6.You will probably have to cook in batches so as not to over load the pan. I start with the thighs which need a little bit more time than the legs. Place each one carefully in the pan and fry, covered, on a good strong simmer for anywhere between 8 to 12 minutes on each side. The heat needs to be high enough to give you a nice brown colour and a crisp finish. Remove and set on the rack to drain. Then do the same with the legs, giving them a couple of minutes less than the thighs."

Any holes that do happen can be patched with a piece of prosciutto or salami during the next step.\nPlace the prosciutto and salami in a single layer over the beef. If there are any holes or thin places in the beef, make sure to place the meat over those areas.\nSpread the breadcrumbs over the salami in an even layer leaving an inch on all sides to make rolling the meat easier. Sprinkle the cheese over the breadcrumbs and drizzle 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over all.\nCarefully fold the edges over and begin to roll the beef.  Tie the roll in several places with kitchen twine and gently rub the outside of the roll with the remaining oil.\nHeat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat. With the aid of tongs, sear the roll all over, including the ends, until nicely browned all over. While the meat is browning, heat the marinara sauce, garlic and wine in a Dutch oven or pan large enough to hold the size of the roll.  Place the browned braciole in the sauce and bring to a gentle simmer.  Cover and braise, over low heat until tender. The braciole in the photograph took 3 hours until a fork inserted into the meat slid in easily.\nWhen tender, carefully remove the beef roll from the sauce and set on a platter. Let the roll cool for about 5-10 minutes and remove the string. Slice the braciole and serve with pasta or gnocchi with the sauce over the top and plenty of parmesan cheese."

NIIIIICE.\nIn goes most of my shredded cheese (I save some for garnish, and for Clayton to pick at), which I stir in well.  I then lower the heat, and let this simmer until thick.  I salt and pepper it to, until it tastes just right.\nIve been cooking my linguine on the back burner, and at just slightly undercooked, its ready to add to the sauce.  I reserve my pasta water, too, so that  if this gets too thick  I can add a little starchy wetness to the pan until the sauce is the right consistency.\nThe last ingredient to add to the pan is my abundance of sliced scallions (reserving some for garnish, too).  I toss this in, remove from the heat, and stir well before\nSwirling my pasta into my waiting ramekins, using tongs to make a nice nest for\nThe addition of a single, cracked (but not the yolk!), farm fresh egg for the center.  This goes in my 350 degree oven, on middle shelf, for 10 minutes to bake  just until the whites are set, but the yolk is still runny.\nOh, I also split a nice small loaf of french bread down the middle, spread it with hot melted butter, and top it with shredded robusto cheese.  I put this in the oven, too, on the top shelf, and let the cheese melt and toast while my eggs are setting.\nScrumdillyicious!\nRight before service, I sprinkle some black truffle oil (Thanks, Tom!) and some black pepper salt over the dish, just to add that umame savor that separates this meal from any ol linguine alfredo.  Served with my toasted cheese bread for sopping, I pierce the quivering sun in the middle of my creamy pasta tresses, and I dive into this hot, simple, elegant, perfect little meal.  30 minutes + very few ingredients = utter weeknight dining perfection!"

        "instructions": "First off, mix the flours together and whisk so they are combined well.\nThis recipe requires you to make a sponge. For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark.\nStir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour.\nPrep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper.\nPunch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes.\nOil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400F(200C).\nTake the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife.\nWhen done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes.\nThis bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!"

I used an immersion blender for the mayo tends to 'seize in little pieces from the cold milk. The immersion blender made it all smooth.\nUnroll your phyllo dough and cover with a damp paper towel. Either grease your 8 inch springform pan with cooking spray or melted butter. Uncover your dough and remove two sheets of phyllo (replacing the damp towel) and lay into your springform pan. Take your pastry brush and coat it with butter. Making sure the phyllo 'sticks' to the sides. Rotate pan a bit and repeat with two more layers and butter. Keep rotating and layering and buttering until you have quite a thick 'phyllo' nest. Roughly about 3/4 of the roll. Since there are 20 sheets to a roll and you are putting down 2 layers at a time; this will be about 14-16 sheets)\nSince your broccoli is cool now, roughly chop it and mix it in with the bacon and cheese mixture. Put the broccoli/bacon/cheese mix into your phyllo nest and gently pat down. Remix your egg mixture (pepper and flour may settle a bit) and pour over your broccoli mixture.\nTake your remaining phyllo sheets and put on top 2 layers at a time coating with butter in between. Roll your over hanging edges with the phyllo sides to create a 'crust edge'. Brush top with butter.\nBake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. You may need to cover the phyllo after an hour to keep it from overbrowning. Let sit 15 minutes before cutting (you don't want everything to ooze out on you).\nBe careful cutting very gently so you don't MASSACRE your phyllo dough. Use a serrated knife and gently saw. When you get to the bottom where the phyllo is more thick....you don't have to be so gentle."

Allow mixture to cool 20 minutes; this allows the flavors to infuse.  Pour mixture in a large container and refrigerate a few hours until cool.\nIf using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly (the one I used sits on the counter. You just plug it in, turn it on chill mode, allow the built-in bowl to get cool, then pour in the ice cream mixture. You then turn on the churn setting and turn the timer on for 25 minutes.  It works its magic and you have wonderful ice cream by the time dinner is consumed).\nYou can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the mixture in a freezer-safe container and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker, small ice crystals will form and the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but it will still be damn delicious!\nSide note: We had leftovers when I made this and we froze them in a Tupperware container. The ice cream gets to be frozen solid so when you go to eat the leftovers, make sure you thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in."

Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil.

Beat the eggs with the milk (again milk is optional), salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices desired.4. Add any desired add-ins (other than cheese) to the skillet. For the pittata, we didn't use anything, but this is when you would add your cooked vegetables or raw vegetables that don't require much cooking (e.g. bell pepper). Pour in the egg mixture and tilt the skillet to ensure it evenly surrounds any add-ins. Now distribute the shredded cheese and pepperoni slices (if using).5. Allow the eggs to cook on the stove until the edges of the eggs are set. The center will still be a bit jiggly. Now is a good time to top with Parmesan cheese (be generous!)6. Transfer the pan to the hot oven and bake until the eggs are puffed and browned with a firm center. Remove from oven and let cool for a couple minutes before cutting into wedges."
